# Maximum Words

The goal of this small project is to find the set of words in portuguese that cover the most amount of characters with no repetition.

There are two cpp files:
- `maximum_words.cpp`: This file will recursively check for every set of words (it's really slow) but finds intermediate solutions.
- `perfect_pangram.cpp`: This file looks only for perfect pangrams. TO BE IMPLEMENTED

The file `wordsList` contains a list of words in the portuguese language. The file should have this name and be located in the same folder of the cpps.

Please note that this file is not optimal since there are a lot of acronyms and some english words.
